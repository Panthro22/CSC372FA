Computer Programming II

In this course, students will focus on advanced concepts in object-oriented programming, using the Java programming language. Specifically, the programs that students develop will support typical business-processing activities. Advanced concepts related to using inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces will be presented in the course.

Students will also build applications that utilize graphical user interfaces to process user inputs and outputs and focus on advanced programming concepts, such as recursion, sorting, and the Java collections framework.

## Topics Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming with Java
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) Programming
- Recursion and Recursive Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Java Collections Framework

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply advanced object-oriented programming concepts in Java.
- Design and implement applications that support typical business-processing activities.
- Utilize inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces effectively in their programs.
- Develop graphical user interfaces to process user inputs and outputs.
- Demonstrate knowledge of recursion and apply it to solve problems.
